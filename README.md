Future work
- Content analysis to understand what drives the engagement of the users e.g. deeper semantic
understanding of top  and least performing posts.  
- Caption analysis to understand the ones that do well, e.g. whether occurrence of certain keywords or CTAs increase engagement.
- Better NLP tools like LLMs to understand the sentiment of the comments 
and impact of captions.
